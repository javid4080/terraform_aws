# terraform_aws
Issue#1
while making use of terraform resource `provisioner --> connection`, getting error "Failed to read ssh private key: no key found"
although the key does present on the given path.

reason : terraform v0.12 doesnot support private/public keys generated by puttygen those are in `.ppk` format.
https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/convert-pem-file-into-ppk/

solution : 
1) To generate open ssh keys --> https://compbio.cornell.edu/about/resources/linux-ssh-keys-and-ssh-key-generation/
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048  (do not specify any passphrase while key creation, as terraform again not support encrypted private keys)
2) Step#1 does solve the promblem for terraform to login on ec2 and execute given provisioner instructions
   but, its not possible to login to an instance by using the open-ssh keys which are in .pem format. thus
3) Make use of Putty-Gen to convert the given private key (which is in .pem format) to .ppk
4) Open PuttyGen --> click on Conversions -> import key --> and then same private key (.ppk) and public key
5) Make use of the available .ppk private key to login inside ec2 by using putty
